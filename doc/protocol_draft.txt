** Introduction **

Proposal for simple communication protocol between two processes: 1) "Server":
process that reads data from EEG device and performs analysis/classification of
the data.  2) "Client": a process using the results of the analysis done by the
server.

Only one client is allowed to be connected to the server at any time.

For convenient debugging, messages in the protocol are UTF-8 encoded strings,
separated by return+newline (\r\n) characters. This allows for impersonation of a
server or client through the netcat (nc) utility. 

The order in which the messages are send or received is not specified to allow
the protocol to be stateless. The delay between two messages is not specified.

The messages have the global form of:
[category] [command] [value] [value] [value] ...
[category] and [command] are not case sensitive.

** Regular expression to tokenize messages **

(?:                     # switch on different datatypes
    
    (

    )               

)                       # end switch on datatypes

Each match of the above expression will be a token. Only one of the
four capture groups will have content, depending on the token type:

group 1: string
group 2: quoted string (quotes stripped)
group 3: integer
group 4: float

< MARKER <type> <code> [timestamp]
    Instruct the server to label the EEG stream with a marker-code. Usually,
    classifiers require the EEG data to be labeled in a certain way for their
    training algorithms to function properly. See the documentation of the
    classifiers for details on this.

	Arguments:
	type - Either 'trigger' or 'switch'. A marker of type trigger marks a single
	       EEG sample witht the specified code. A marker of type switch will
           mark all subsequent EEG samples with the specified code.

    code - An integer value ranged [0-255] that serves as a label for the
           marker. 

    timestamp - A float value to indicate the exact timing of the marker. If
                omitted the time at which the server receives the MARKER
                command will be used, which will introduce delayes and is
                therefore unreliable. Timestamps are generated on Windows by
                the 'QueryPerformanceTimer()' function and on UNIX systems by
                the 'time()' function.

< MODE SET <name>
    Change the operating mode of the server. There are 4 modes:
    idle         - doing nothing, initial state.
    data-collect - collecting data only. This mode is used by the classifiers
                   to gather training data.
    training     - server is training the classifier on the previously
                   gathered data, performing the sometimes lengthy calculations.
	application  - server is applying the classifier online.

< MODE GET
    Request the current mode of the server.

> MODE PROVIDE <value>
    Send whenever the server changes mode or as a response to MODE GET.

    Arguments:
    value - The name of the current mode of the server.

< RESULT GET
    Informs the server that a classification result is requested as soon as
    possible.

> RESULT PROVIDE value+ [timestamp]
    Whenever the server as a classification result ready, this is passed to the
    client with the RESULT PROVIDE message. Note that the server can supply
    results even without explicitly asked with a RESULT GET message.

    Arguments:
    values    - A list of values that represent the classification result.
    timestamp - An optional timestamp for which the classification result is
                valid if the result is time sensitive. This can for instance be
                the onset of a trial or the exact moment a change in SSVEP
                response is detected.

< PING
    Request a PONG response from the server to verify its responsiveness.

> PONG
    Response to PING message: response from the server that it is still alive.

** Device drivers available: **

Parameters shared by all devices:
"bdf_file" <string>
Filename of a BDF file to write recorded data to. Any previous data in the file
will be overwritten.

"timing_mode" <string>
Selects one of 5 different strategies to label the data with timing information.
Since many devices are wireless and offer no time synchronization, it must be
estimated by a combination of the system timer and assumptions about the
sample rate of the device. Possible values for "timing_mode" are:
    "begin_read_relative": The default. Before every read call to the device
    (interval depends on the value of "buffer_size_seconds") it marks the time
    using the system timer and uses this as the timing for the first data frame.
    The rest of the data that was read will be labeled by assuming a fixed
    sample rate. Generally a good tradeoff if the sample rate of the device is
    more or less accurate.

    "end_read_relative": As "begin_read_relative", but it marks the time after
    the read call from the device has returned and labels the data in
    retrospect assuming a fixed sample rate of the device. This mode assumes
    that data becomes available as data is being read, which is usually not the
    case, so consider using "begin_read_relative".

    "estimated_sample_rate": This mode does not assume that the sample rate of
    the device is known or stable, and relies solely on the system timer. If the
    device is wireless, this will result in small random timing errors as
    packets are buffered, lost, found, etc. 

    "smoothed_sample_rate": This mode does assume that the sample rate of the
    device is more or less stable, but unknown. It works like
    "estimated_sample_rate", but keeps a running average of the sample rate (a
    window of 10 seconds) to smooth out its timing errors.

    "fixed": Only labels the very first frame (T0) using the system timer, from
    that point onwards, assumes a fixed sample rate of the device. If the sample
    rate of the device is not constant or not exactly specified (which is often
    the case), timing will 'drift' away. Use this one with care.

"buffer_size_seconds" <float>
Data is continuously read from the device in chunks. This parameter controls
the size of these chunks in seconds. The smaller the chunks, the more
responsive the system can be, at the expense of using more system resources.
Defaults to 0.5.

"channel_names" <string>+
Sets a name for each channel. The length of the list must be equal or greater
than the number of channels available on the device. Any excess names will be
ignored. For the epoc and biosemi devices, the channel names default to the
standard 10-20 labels of the electrode positions. For the emulator and imec
devices, which have no default electrode positions, the channels are numbered
by default.

"target_channels" (<int>|<string>)+
Selects the channels to record from either by integer index or name (see also the
"channel_names" parameter). Data from channels that are not selected is
discarded. Defaults to recording from all available channels.

"nchannels" <int> [read only]
Number of channels the device has. 

"samplerate" <float> [read only]
Samplerate of the device.

* The Emulator ("emulator") *

This is not an actual device. This driver pretends a device is attached, which
is useful for testing your code without access to actual hardware. The data it
generates is either random noise, or you can supply a BDF file to read data from
and play it back including any labeling present in the file. The default timing
strategy for this device is "fixed".

Parameters:
"buffer_size_seconds" <float>
Size of the internal buffer. Default to 0.5 seconds.

"bdf_playback_file" <string>
Filename of a BDF file to read data from for playback.

"nchannels" <int>
Number of channels to emulate. Defaults to 8. (Cannot be used in combination
with "bdf_playback_file").

"samplerate" <float>
Samplerate of data to emulate. Defaults to 1000Hz. (Cannot be used in
combination with "bdf_playback_file").


* The Emotive EPOC ("epoc") *

This is the wireless EPOC device produced by Emotiv. The Emotiv Developer
Toolkit must be installed in order to use this device, as it depends on edk.dll.
Be aware that the device offers no time synchronization, but has a stable sample
rate. The default timing strategy for this device is "begin_read_relative".

Parameters:
No specific parameters for this device.

* The IMEC device developed in Belgium ("imec-be") *

Our first 'real' EEG device we had access to. Be aware of the fact that its
sample rate is not stable. The default timing strategy for this device is
"smoothed_sample_rate" .

Parameters:
"port" <string>
COM port on which the device is attached. If this parameter is not supplied, an
automatic scan is performed to determine the COM port, which usually works
unless multiple EEG devices are connected. On windows, the format of the
parameter is "COM#" where # can be any number. On UNIX systems, the parameter is
the absolute pathname to the device (for example "/dev/tty.usb10001").

"test" <int>
Set this to 1 to enable the test mode of the device. In the test mode, the
device will output a simulated brain response with a different phase on each
channel. Useful for debugging purposes. Default value is 0.

* The IMEC device developed in the Netherlands ("imec-nl") *

An updated version of the IMEC-BE device which has a more stable sample rate.
The default timing strategy for this device is "begin_read_relative".

Parameters:
"port" <string>
COM port on which the device is attached. If this parameter is not supplied, an
automatic scan is performed to determine the COM port, which usually works
unless multiple EEG devices are connected. On windows, the format of the
parameter is "COM#" where # can be any number. On UNIX systems, the parameter is
the absolute pathname to the device (for example "/dev/tty.usb10001").

* The Biosemi ActiveTwo *

Our research grade 32 channel EEG system developed by Biosemi. In addition to
having a stable sample rate, this device offers synchronization using a
trigger cable that is connected to the parallel port. By default, the trigger
cable is assumed not to be present and the timing will be estimated using
"begin_read_relative". See the "status_as_markers" parameter to use the
trigger cable.

Also remember that the default reference of the device is the CMS electrode,
which is most likely not optimal. Use the "reference_channels" parameter to
supply the desired reference (for example, two external channels placed on the
mastoids).

Parameters:
"status_as_markers" <int>
Set to 1 to use the status channel to extract markers. When set, all MARKER
messages will be ignored and instead the values of the trigger cable are
taken. When set to 1, timing mode is set to "fixed", when set to 0, timing
mode is set to "begin_read_relative". Don't forget to supply the LPT port
the trigger cable is connected to using the "port" parameter. Trigger cable is
only supported on windows for the moment. Defaults to 0.

"port" <string>
LPT port on which the trigger cable is attached in the form of 'LPT#'.
Defaults to "LPT1".

"reference_channels" (<int>|<string>)+ 
Channel(s) to use as a reference. Can be specified either as an integer index
or by their name (see also the "channel_names" parameter all devices share).
If more than one channel is specified, their average is used.



** Classifiers available **

* An on/off SSVEP detector based on the SLIC algorithm ("ssvep-slic") * 

The paradigm is that there is a single SSVEP stimulus on the screen. The
classifier indicates whether the user is looking at the stimulus or looking away
from it.

Training data consists of a sequence for some periods where the user is looking
at the stimulus, labeled with a 'switch' marker valued 1, intermixed with
periods where the user is looking away from the stimulus, labeled with a
'switch' marker valued 2.

The results come in the form of:
    RESULT PROVIDE slic-value looking
Where 'slic-value' is a float containing the current output value of the SLIC
algorithm, useful for displaying on the screen. 'looking' is 1 when the user is
looking at the SSVEP stimulus and 0 otherwise.

Parameters:
"freq" <float>
The frequency of the SSVEP stimulus. Be sure to always set this parameter. It
defaults to 12.8 Hz.

"thresholds" <float> <float>
Setting/getting the high and low thresholds of the classifier. These are
determined during the training phase but can be tweaked during application.

"window_size" <float>
"window_step" <float>
The size and step parameters of the sliding window in seconds. A bigger window
means a more reliable classification result at the cost of a larger delay
before this result is reached. By default "window_size" is 1.0 and
"window_step" is 0.5 seconds. When using the EPOC, try setting the
"window_size" to at least 1.5 for better accuracy. The "window_step" is best
kept at the same value as "buffer_size_seconds".

"bandpass" <float> <float>
The hipass and lopass frequencies in Hz of the bandpass filter applied to the
data. By default this is 0.3 -- 30 Hz.

* A 'classifier' that plots an ERP ("erp-plotter") *

Used for demonstration purposes. The client presents a set of stimuli to the
user. Each stimulus is presented multiple times. This classifier will cut out
EEG segments in a given window around the stimulus onsets. The event-related
potential (ERP) is obtained for each stimulus, by averaging the EEG segments
corresponding to the moments the stimulus was shown to the user. The resulting
plot, with all ERPs drawn on top of each other for easy comparison, is returned
as classification result.

This classifier only uses training data. It does nothing in application mode.

Training data consists of a sequence stimuli, each labeled with their own
unique integer. Each time a stimulus is shown to the user, a 'trigger' marker
is send with the corresponding integer label.

After training, the resulting plot comes in the form of:
    RESULT PROVIDE "training-result" "...base64 encoded png file"

Parameters:
"window" <float> <float>
Sets the window that is extracted around the onset of each trial. Values are in
seconds. The default is 0.0 -- 1.0 seconds. Try setting this to 0.2 -- 0.5 to
only capture the P300 potential.

"bandpass" <float> <float>
The hipass and lopass frequencies in Hz of the bandpass filter applied to the
data. By default this is 0.5 -- 15 Hz.

"cl_lab" <string>+
A list of class labels to use in the plot. Supply one value for each unique
stimulus.

"format" <string>
File format of the resulting plot. Defaults to "png", but can be any supported
by the matplotlib savefig() function:
  "png", "pdf", "ps", "eps" and "svg"

* A general purpose P300 classifier ("p300") *

Presented with multiple options on the screen, the user chooses one to pay
attention to. The options are highlighted one by one and the user counts the
number of times his chosen option is highlighted. The classifier will detect the
P300 potential elicited by the chosen selection option.

Training data consists of a sequence of N options. The user will focus on each
option, marked by the 'trigger' marker valued 100 + option. For example, if the
user is paying attention to option 3, the value of the marker is 103. After this
marker, each time a selection option is highlighted, a 'trigger' marker with the
number of the highlighted option is send. When the user focuses on another
selection option, a new 'trigger' marker valued 100 + option is required to
indicate this.

The results come in the form of:
    RESULT PROVIDE lda-scores+ selected_option
Where 'lda_scores+' are the raw values returned by the LDA step of the
classifier, useful for displaying on the screen. 'selected_option' is 0 if the
classifier does not know, and >0 to indicate the selected option.

Parameters:
"num_options" <int>
Required parameter. Sets the number of options on the screen. Set this first
during training, and later on during the application whenever the number of
options changes.

"num_repetitions" <int>
The number of times each option is highlighted. The classifier collects
"num_repetitions" of trials for each option before averaging them to form ERPs.

"classifications_needed" <int>
Defaults to 1. Setting a value higher than 1 will cause the classifier to
require at least this much coherent classifications before reporting a detected
choice. This can be used for creating a self-paced BCI.

"target_sample_rate" <float>
Signal is downsampled to "target_sample_rate" before attempting classification.
The default value is 128 Hz.

"window" <float> <float>
Sets the window that is extracted around the onset of each trial. Values are in
seconds. The default is 0.0 -- 1.0 seconds. Try setting this to 0.2 -- 0.5 to
only capture the P300 potential.

"bandpass" <float> <float>
The hipass and lopass frequencies in Hz of the bandpass filter applied to the
data. By default this is 0.5 -- 15 Hz.
